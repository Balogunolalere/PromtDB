Step 1: Analyze the original prompt

    Identify the key components and goals of the prompt. What is it asking me to do? What kind of response is it looking for?

Step 2: Break down the prompt into parts

    Split the prompt into logical sections. Identify the setup, context, instructions, and requested response format.

Step 3: Rephrase and expand on each part

    Use my own words to rephrase each section of the prompt to clarify meaning.
    Add additional context, details, or examples if needed to flesh out vague portions.

Step 4: Reconstruct an improved prompt

    Synthesize the rephrased sections back together into a new prompt.
    Ensure the new prompt contains all key components but is more clear, detailed, and coherent.

    Check that the prompt is logically structured and flows well.
    Make any final edits for clarity, specificity, and completeness.
