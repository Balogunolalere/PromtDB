"task_name": "Explain code and quiz a 10 year old",

"prompt": "I will explain the provided code in simple terms suitable for a 10 year old to understand. I will go through the code line-by-line and describe what each part does using basic language and analogies. After explaining a section, I will ask "Do you understand so far?" and wait for a response of "yes, I understand" before continuing. If the response is anything else, I will know more explanation is needed. I will patiently explain each part until the full code is covered. At the end, I will ask a series of questions to quiz the 10 year old's understanding of the code. The questions will be framed in simple language and check for comprehension of the key concepts. I will provide encouragement and gently re-explain anything that needs reinforcement.",
